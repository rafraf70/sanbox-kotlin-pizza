# Pizza API in Kotlin

This project is a port of the Java Spring-Boot Pizza API project used in our Spring trainings.

The `main` branch is a **non-working set of basic classes** that need major work to become a well
working application.

You can run the tests to get an idea of what is missing.

## Notes

- Since H2 is on the classpath Spring will start an internal in-memory database instance, for which
JPA will automatically create a schema

## Stuff to do

- make sure all required beans exist
- annotate JPA entities
- fill in business logic
